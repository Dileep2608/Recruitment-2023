Description of my approach to the problem:

1. THREE KALAS : 
        here i am printing "Yes", if "X" is equal to "A" or "B" or "C".
        else print "No"

2. GOOD DAY? :
        count the number of "1's" and number of "0's", if number of 1's is greater than number of 0's then print "YES", else print "NO".

3. A MARATHON : 
        first find the value of D*A, it is equal to distance traveled by Ram. 
        Depending on the range in which this total distance lies, the output is printed

4. THE BEST BOW AND ARROW :
        if a, b == a1, b1 interchangeably, then print "1"
        elif a, b == a2, b2 interchangably, then print "2"
        else print "0"

5. LAKSHMAN AND HIS STICKS:
        if length of stick is even, then irrespect of if the desired length is even or odd, it can be splitted paritly.
        because if desired length is odd, then the total length can be splitted as desired length part and other part as parts of length equal to 1.
        and if desired lenght is even, then the total length can be splitted as desired lenght part and other part as parths of lenght equal to 2.

        if length of stick is odd, then if desired length is odd, it can be splitted but if its even it can't be splitted.

        so we print "NO", if N and X are odd and even respectively, 
        else, we print "YES"

6. MATA SITA'S DOLLS:
    create a dictonary with keys as doll number and corresponding values as number of corresponding doll
    if a 'value' in above dictonary is odd then that corresponding 'key' doll is missing
     
7.  WAY TO ASHRAM:
    if the coordinates(x and y) of destination are multiple of value(K), it is possible to reach Ashram, so print "YES", else print "NO"
